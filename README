Color Image Generator

This is a very simple ImageMagick-based script that generates an
image of specified size, filled with the specified color (by hex
code).

Image is displayed next to the form which defined the attributes.
It is also possible to download the image by clicking on it.

In case when multiple colors are specified, the generated image will
be filled with the first color and have a progressively smaller box
for each of the additional colors.
